# River water level measurement

The main purpose of that project is to access data from **hydro.imgw.pl** website and present the data using **ESP32** device connected to the Internet

### First steps - Python program
I have written Python code to get to know with data from the website mentioned above :)

### ESP32 code
So far, it displays water level and timestamp. Remember to change the credentials to your Wi-Fi SSID and password.

### TODO:
- autoupdate every 1 hour
- menu with more options
- switching between multiple locations
